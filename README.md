# Trading Execution Engine

A high-performance, low-latency trading execution system designed to handle rapid financial transactions. I've tried to create a scalable infrastructure for processing market data and executing trades.

## Features

- **Low-latency**: optimized for quick response times and high throughput.
- **Distributed architecture**: scalable and fault-tolerant for real-time financial trading.
- **Data ingestion**: handles large amounts of market data sourced from the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Risk management**: includes basic checks and balances for trade execution.
- **Extendable**: built with modularity in mind for future enhancements.

## Requirements

- **C++11 or later**
- **CMake** for building project
- **GCC/Clang** or **MinGW-w64** for compiling
- **MSYS2** (on Windows) or any Linux/MacOS-based system for development
